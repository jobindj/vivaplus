# Shoulder and Upper Extremity

## Skeletal Structure

### Humerus

Paper: Cortical thickness analysis of the **proximal humerus** [@Majed2017]

Paper: Regional variations of **cortical bone in the humeral head region**: A preliminary study [@Wang2018]

Paper: (Cortical thickness on the shaft) Measurement of the bony anatomy of the humerus using magnetic resonance imaging [@Murdoch2002]

Paper: Three-dimensional distribution of trabecular bone density and cortical thickness in the **distal humerus** [@Diederichs2009]

## Joints
For the VIRTUAL version of the VIVA+ models, joint will be assumed as kinematic joints.
### Shoulder


### Elbow
Humerus und Ulnar are connected with a revolute joint (axis through medial and lateral epicondyle of humerus)
Humerus and Radius are connected with a spherical joint (center of rotation on tip of Radius)
Radius and Ulnar are connected with a spherical joint on the distal end (center of roation on US - ulnar styloid)

## Gender Differences

Paper: Gender differences in the ratio between humerus width and length are established prior to puberty [@Clark2006]

Paper: Dimensions and estimated mechanical characteristics of the humerus after long-term tennis loading [@Haapasalo1993]

## Changes due to aging

Paper: High-Resolution Tomography-Based Quantification of **Cortical Porosity and Cortical Thickness at the Surgical Neck** of the Humerus During Aging [@Helfen2017]
