## Joints
For the VIRTUAL version of the VIVA+ models, joint will be assumed as kinematic joints.
### Shoulder


### Elbow
Humerus und Ulnar are connected with a revolute joint (axis through medial and lateral epicondyle of humerus)
Humerus and Radius are connected with a spherical joint (center of rotation on tip of Radius)
Radius and Ulnar are connected with a spherical joint on the distal end (center of roation on US - ulnar styloid)

## Gender Differences

Paper: Gender differences in the ratio between humerus width and length are established prior to puberty [@Clark2006]

Paper: Dimensions and estimated mechanical characteristics of the humerus after long-term tennis loading [@Haapasalo1993]

## Changes due to aging

Paper: High-Resolution Tomography-Based Quantification of **Cortical Porosity and Cortical Thickness at the Surgical Neck** of the Humerus During Aging [@Helfen2017]
