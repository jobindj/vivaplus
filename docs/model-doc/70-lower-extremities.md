## Bones

### Femur

The femur crossectional are was optimised to meet the target values of Klein et al. (2015) [@Klein2015].
The following target values were used (applying the regression model described in the paper and using age, stature and BMI of the 50F VIVA + models (50years, 161.6cm, 24 kg/m^2)
An elliptic inner shape was aussumed, which is in line with medical images. However, if a proper inner geometry becomes available, this should be updated. The maximum difference to the reference is 3.3%.

140 beams were created oriented as described in Elamrani et al., 2013 [@Elamrani2013]: "Fibers of the anterior layer made an angle of 13° (SD 2.6) with the axis of fibula. Those of the posterior layer made an angle of 24.2° (SD 2.48) with the axis of fibula."
The avarage thickness is 0.54 mm

Stiffness of anterior tibiofibular ligament: 162 +/- 64 N/mm [@Hoefnagels2007]

stiffness in fiber direction is assumed based on Minns and Hunter [@Minns1976] 
For the 2mm x 20mm sample an ultimate stress of  920 ±/- 205 Kgf/cm^2  = 0.09022118 GPa is reported at 7.7%

Assuming linear stiffness up to the ultimate stress, a young modulus of 1.17 GPa can be assumed. 
 for a sample with a crossection of 2x0.54=~1mm^2

For the ligaments connecting the proximal end, a higher stiffness was assumed. It was set to 5 GPa as first trial. (TODO: Check for reference)

#### Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL)

LaPrade et al.(2003): "The average cross-sectional area of the fibular collateral ligament attachment site on the femur was 0.48 cm2 (range, 0.43 to 0.52).

##### Femur Attachment
According to Kamath et al. (2010), the femoral LCL insertion(black dot) is 58%±4.7% across the width of the lateral femoral condyle along the Blumensaat line and 2.3±2.3 mm distal to this point.


##### Fibula attachement:
LaPrade, 2003: "As the fibular collateral ligament coursed distally and attached on the lateral aspect of the fibular head, its average attachment was 8.2 mm (range, 6.8 to 9.7) posterior to the anterior margin of the fibular head and 28.4 mm (range, 25.1 to 30.6) distal to the tip of the fibular styloid process (Table 1). The average cross-sectional area of the attachment on the fibular head was 0.43 cm2 (range, 0.39 to 0.50). The fibular collateral ligament attachment was, on average, 38% (range, 28% to 46%) of the total width of the fibular head (anterior to posterior) from the anterior edge of the fibular head. The majority of the distal attachment was found in a bony depression that extended to approximately the distal one-third of the lateral aspect of the fibular head (Figs. 1 and 2). The remaining fibers extended further distally along with the peroneus longus fascia.25,26 The average total length of the fibular collateral ligament between its attachment sites was 69.6 mm (range, 62.6 to 73.5)."

#### Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL)

based on Wijdicks et al. 2009 - values in table 5 will be used

Additionally, pictures from Prince et al. (2015) were used.

##### Femur attachement

https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2212628715001401-gr5.jpg

"line 1 is an extension of the posterior femoral cortex, and line 2 is drawn perpendicular to line 1, intersecting the most posterior aspect of the Blumensaat line"
"The femoral attachment of the sMCL was found to be, on average, 8.6 mm anterior to the posterior femoral cortex line and 11.0 mm distal to the intersection of the posterior femoral cortex line (line 1) and the line intersecting the posterior aspect of the Blumensaat line (line 2)"

##### Tibia attachement

"On the lateral tibial radiographs, the proximal and distal
tibial attachments of the superficial medial collateral ligament were 15.9 ± 5.2 and 66.1 ± 3.6 mm distal to the tibial
inclination, respectivel"

#### Anterior cruciate Ligament (ACL)
Harner et al. 1999 (from Bedi et al., 2018) "The ACL is formed by 2 main bundles, the anteromedial (AM)and posterolateral (PL) bundles, which are named for their tibialinsertions and provide the primary restraint against anterior tibialtranslation and secondary restraint against internal tibial rotation,respectively. It is 31±2 mm long with a mean diameter of 10±2mm6, although it fans out at the insertions to approximately 3.5times the midsubstance width7."

The distance between the attachment point in the baseline setated VIVA+ model is 31mm.

##### Femur Insertion:
ACL attachment point on femur is determined based on the radiographic quadrant mehtod: "distance t (representing the total sagittal diameter of the lateral condyle measured along Blumensaat's line), distance h (representing the maximum intercondylar notch height), distance a (representing the distance of point K from the most dorsal subchondral contour of the lateral femoral condyle), and distance b (representing the distance of point K from Blumensaat's line). Distance a is a partial distance of t and distance b is a partial distance of h, and distances a and b are expressed as length ratios of t and h. The center of the femoral insertion of the ACL was located at 24.8% of the distance t measured from the most posterior contour of the lateral femoral condyle and at 28.5% of the height h measured from Blumensaat's line. Based on these results, the ACL can be found just inferior to the most superoposterior quadrant, which means in anatomic terms it is localized from the dorsal border of the condyle at approximately a quarter of the whole sagittal diameter of the condyle and from the roof of the notch at approximately a quarter of the notch height. "

Accoridng to Yahagi et al. 2018, who are proposing a method which is applicabel also for cases where the Blumensaat's line is not a straight line, the hill is excluded to derive the Blumensaat line (grid 1)

Yahagi et al. 2018: "In small hill type knees, the ACL center was placed as follows: Grid (1) 37.5 ± 6% in the shallow–deep, 50.2 ± 8.3% in the high–low directions. [..]
In large hill type knees, the ACL center was placed as follows: Grid (1) 37.1 ± 5.6% in the shallow–deep, 50.4 ± 5.8% in the high–low directions"

Method to derive both bundle attachements (Pietrini et al. 2011):

##### Tibia insertion:
Stӓubli and Rauschning: 43.3% of the anterior-to-posterior distance acrossthe tibia as measured at the level of the posterior tibial margin at the posterior intercondylar area.In their study,the anteriormost fibers inserted at 27.5% across the plateau

Frank et al., 2010: "The average AP diameter of the tibia was measured to be 50 ± 4 mm (range 40–64 mm). Female knees averaged 47 ± 3 mm compared to 52 ± 4 mm in men. The anterior-most position of the ACL attachment on the tibia was, on average, 14 ± 3 mm (range 8–26 mm) from the anterior edge of the tibia, or 28 ± 5% the total depth of the tibia. In women, the anterior-most position of the insertion was, on average, 13 ± 2 mm (28 ± 5%) compared to 15 ± 3 mm (28 ± 5%) in men. The posterior-most position of the ACL attachment on the tibia was located, on average, 31 ± 4 mm (range 23–40) from the anterior edge of the tibia, or 63 ± 6% the depth of the tibia. In women, the posterior-most position was, on average, 29 ± 3 mm (62 ± 5%) contrasted to 33 ± 4 mm (64 ± 5%) in men. Finally, the central portion of the ACL attachment on the tibia was located, on average, 23 ± 3 mm (range 16–30 mm). This center position corresponds to a point 46 ± 4% of the total tibial AP diameter as described. In women, this position was located at 21 ± 2 mm (45 ± 4%) compared to 24 ± 3 mm (46 ± 4%) in men. It was determined that the ACL takes up an average 36 ± 6% of the sagittal depth of the tibia and that the tibial insertion of the ACL is located between 28 and 63% of the total depth of the tibia in the anterior–posterior (sagittal) plane."

#### Posterior cruciate Ligament (PCL)

Johannnsen et al., 2013: Positionining of the bundles based on relative values provided in table 1,2 and 3 of the publication.

The distance between the attachment point in the baseline seated VIVA+ model is 36mm

#### Meniscus
The average thickness of the medial meniscus is 2.55 mm according to [@Bloecker2011] (40 male and 62 female knees were measured in MRI) For males it should be 2.8 mm.

#### Knee Cartilage
Cartilage thickness is based on (TODO for UL)


#### Patella ligament

The attachment point on the tibia is 36mm below the most distal edge of the patella.

This is in line with @Yoo2007, where an average value of 38 mm was reported from the 30 female knees which were measrued in MRIs.

They report a proximal width of 27.5 mm and a tickness of 3 mm while for the distal tendon a tickness of 4.6 mm and a width of 21.5 mm is reported.
