In addition, few complications occur at donor sites. However, a large, systematic, and detailed investigation of clinicoanatomic problems of the fibula has not been performed. Therefore, in the present study, the fibula was examined morphologically and morphometrically, with special attention to regions important in the placement of dental implants. Eighty fibulae obtained from cadavers of 41 Japanese individuals aged 46 to 92 years (mean, 72.7 years) were fixed with 70% alcohol after infusion of about 6 liters of 10% formalin via the femoral artery. Morphometric examination showed the nutrient foramen was located posteriorly in 85.0% of sections, the maximal width of fibular cross sections was 13.1 mm, and the maximal cortical thickness of fibular cross sections was 4.1 mm.},

  abstract     = {Musculoskeletal models are important tools for studying movement patterns, tissue loading, and neuromechanics. Personalising bone anatomy within models improves analysis accuracy. Few studies have focused on personalising foot bone anatomy, potentially incorrectly estimating the foot's contribution to locomotion. Statistical shape models have been created for a subset of foot-ankle bones, but have not been validated. This study aimed to develop and validate statistical shape models of the functional segments in the foot: first metatarsal, midfoot (second-to-fifth metatarsals, cuneiforms, cuboid, and navicular), calcaneus, and talus; then, to assess reconstruction accuracy of these shape models using sparse anatomical data. Magnetic resonance images of 24 individuals feet (age = 28 ± 6 years, 52% female, height = 1.73 ± 0.8 m, mass = 66.6 ± 13.8 kg) were manually segmented to generate three-dimensional point clouds. Point clouds were registered and analysed using principal component analysis. For each bone segment, a statistical shape model and principal components were created, describing population shape variation. Statistical shape models were validated by assessing reconstruction accuracy in a leave-one-out cross validation. Statistical shape models were created by excluding a participant's bone segment and used to reconstruct that same excluded bone using full segmentations and sparse anatomical data (i.e. three discrete points on each segment), for all combinations in the dataset. Tali were not reconstructed using sparse anatomical data due to a lack of externally accessible landmarks. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using Jaccard index, root mean square error (mm), and Hausdorff distance (mm). Reconstructions generated using full segmentations had mean Jaccard indices between 0.77 ± 0.04 and 0.89 ± 0.02, mean root mean square errors between 0.88 ± 0.19 and 1.17 ± 0.18 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 2.99 ± 0.98 mm and 6.63 ± 3.68 mm. Reconstructions generated using sparse anatomical data had mean Jaccard indices between 0.67 ± 0.06 and 0.83 ± 0.05, mean root mean square error between 1.21 ± 0.54 mm and 1.66 ± 0.41 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 3.21 ± 0.94 mm and 7.19 ± 3.54 mm. Jaccard index was higher (  < 0.01) and root mean square error was lower (  < 0.01) in reconstructions from full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. Hausdorff distance was lower (  < 0.01) for midfoot and calcaneus reconstructions using full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. For the first time, statistical shape models of the primary functional segments of the foot were developed and validated. Foot segments can be reconstructed with minimal error using full segmentations and sparse anatomical landmarks. In future, larger training datasets could increase statistical shape model robustness, extending use to paediatric or pathological populations.},

  abstract     = {IIn order for finite element models of the human body to predict pelvic injuries accurately, the appropriate material properties must be applied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the dynamic material properties of human pelvic cortical bone in tension. In order to accomplish this, a total of 20 tension coupon specimens were obtained from four regions of four human cadaver pelves: anterior ilium wing, posterior ilium wing, superior pubic ramus, and ischium body. For the anterior and posterior regions of the ilium wing, samples were taken in two orientations to investigate any direction dependence. A high-rate servo-hydraulic Material Testing System (MTS) with a custom slack adaptor was used to apply tension loads to failure at a constant loading rate of 0.5 strains/s. The horizontally oriented anterior ilium specimens were found to have a significantly larger ultimate stress (p=0.02), ultimate strain (p>0.01), and modulus (p=0.02) than the vertically oriented anterior ilium specimens. There were no significant differences in ultimate stress (p=0.27), ultimate strain (p=0.85), or modulus (p=0.87) found between horizontally oriented and vertically oriented posterior ilium specimens. However, additional testing should be conducted at specimen orientation 45 degree from the orientations used in the current study to further investigate the effect of specimen orientation on the posterior portion of the ilium wing. There were no significant differences in ultimate stress (p=0.79), ultimate strain (p=0.31), or modulus (p=0.15) found between the superior pubic ramus and ischium body specimens. However, the statistical comparison between superior pubic ramus and ischium body specimens was considered weak due to the limited samples and large variation between subjects.},
